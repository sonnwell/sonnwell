I’m a developer who likes building things that are actually useful. Most of my work is React + JavaScript, and I spend a lot of time thinking about UX, not just code.

Lately I’ve been working on small product-style apps and experimenting with how AI can help automate annoying, error-prone stuff in the real world.

### What I’m up to lately
- Building an AI-powered medical bill auditing tool
- Slowly moving toward full-stack without losing my UI focus
- Figuring out where AI actually helps vs where it’s just hype

---

### Stuff I’m building
**Billometry**  
A private MVP that analyzes medical bills and flags possible errors or overcharges.  
Built with React, TypeScript, Node, and AI-powered analysis.  
Very UX-driven, very practical.

### How I like to work
- I care a lot about clarity and usability
- I’d rather ship something simple than over-engineer
- I use AI as a helper, not a replacement for thinking

---

### Tech I use
HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React  
Currently digging more into Node, databases, and applied AI
