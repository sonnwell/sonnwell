## Sonnie Welling
Frontend Engineer building practical, user-focused web apps with React and JavaScript.

I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into simple, usable products. Lately, that’s meant building small SaaS-style tools and exploring how AI can automate boring or error-prone workflows.

### What I’m working on
- Building an AI-powered medical bill auditing tool (React, TypeScript, Node)
- Leveling up into full-stack development while staying UI-focused
- Exploring AI-assisted workflows for real-world products

### How I approach development
- User experience comes first, even in internal tools
- I prefer shipping something useful over over-engineering
- I use AI to accelerate thinking, not replace it
